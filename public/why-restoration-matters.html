          <h2>Essential Ecosystem Services</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">Shellfish ecosystems provide essential services that support both marine life and human communities. From filtering water to protecting coastlines, these remarkable organisms are foundational to healthy ocean ecosystems.</p>
          <p>Shellfish reefs—whether oyster, mussel, clam, or other bivalve species—act as natural infrastructure that delivers multiple benefits simultaneously. As we face increasing coastal challenges from climate change, pollution, and habitat loss, restoring and protecting shellfish populations has never been more critical.</p>

        <h2>Key Benefits of Shellfish Restoration</h2>
        <div class="benefits-grid">
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>💧 Water Filtration</h4>
            <p>A single adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day, removing excess nutrients, sediment, and pollutants. Restored shellfish populations dramatically improve water quality, creating clearer, healthier coastal waters that support diverse marine life and recreation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>🐟 Critical Habitat</h4>
            <p>Shellfish reefs provide complex three-dimensional habitat structure that serves as nursery grounds for fish, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. The nooks and crannies in oyster reefs support 10 times more species diversity than surrounding soft-bottom habitats.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>🌊 Coastal Protection</h4>
            <p>Natural barriers against storm surge and erosion. Shellfish reefs absorb wave energy, reduce coastal erosion, and protect shorelines from storm damage—services that become increasingly valuable as sea levels rise and storms intensify.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>🌱 Carbon Sequestration</h4>
            <p>Climate change mitigation through carbon storage. Shellfish sequester carbon in their shells and in the sediments they help stabilize, contributing to long-term carbon storage and helping mitigate ocean acidification in localized areas.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>🎣 Sustainable Fisheries</h4>
            <p>Supporting local economies and food security. Healthy shellfish populations support commercial and recreational fisheries, providing sustainable protein sources and economic opportunities for coastal communities while maintaining ecological balance.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>🏛️ Cultural Heritage</h4>
            <p>Preservation of traditional practices. For many Indigenous and coastal communities, shellfish harvesting represents thousands of years of cultural tradition, subsistence practices, and ecological knowledge that restoration efforts help preserve and honor.</p>

        <h2>The Science Behind Restoration</h2>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div>
            <h3>Ecological Engineering</h3>
            <p>Shellfish restoration combines ecological science with engineering principles to create self-sustaining populations. Practitioners use various techniques including substrate placement, spat-on-shell deployment, hatchery supplementation, and careful site selection to maximize restoration success.</p>
            <p>Research shows that restored shellfish reefs can reach ecological functionality within 2-5 years, with benefits accumulating over decades as reefs mature and expand.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Ecosystem Resilience</h3>
            <p>Diverse shellfish populations enhance ecosystem resilience to environmental stressors. By restoring multiple species and maintaining genetic diversity, we create more robust ecosystems capable of adapting to changing conditions.</p>
            <p>Studies demonstrate that shellfish restoration can improve ecosystem resistance to algal blooms, disease outbreaks, and climate-related impacts like warming waters and acidification.</p>

    <!-- Global Impact -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Global Impact and Challenges</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <p>Shellfish populations have declined by 85-90% globally due to overharvesting, habitat destruction, pollution, and disease. This loss represents not only an ecological tragedy but also the loss of trillions of dollars in ecosystem services.</p>

          <p>However, restoration efforts are showing promising results worldwide:</p>

          <ul class="highlight-list">
            <li>Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts have rebuilt millions of oysters, measurably improving water quality</li>
            <li>European mussel bed restoration is enhancing biodiversity in the North Sea</li>
            <li>Pacific oyster restoration supports Indigenous food sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest</li>
            <li>Mangrove-oyster systems in tropical regions provide enhanced coastal protection</li>
            <li>Urban shellfish reefs are transforming polluted harbors into vibrant ecosystems</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="section-closing">Together, we can restore these vital ecosystems and build more resilient coasts. Join ISRS in advancing the science and practice of shellfish restoration worldwide.</p>
