# ISRS Beta Tester Invitation Email

**Subject:** Invitation to Beta Test the New ISRS Website & Member Portal

---

Hi ISRS Board, Advisory Panel, and ICSR 2026 Planning Team,

I'm excited to invite you to beta test the new International Shellfish Restoration Society (ISRS) website and member portal system!

Over the past few months, I've developed a comprehensive web platform for ISRS and ICSR that includes a public website, conference registration system, member portal with directory, admin portal for managing fundraising, abstracts, etc., and an AI-powered photo gallery. And using this new setup, we're saving >$500/yr compared to using Squarespace and conference management software!

**This is the link to use for beta testing:**

## FIRST THINGS FIRST: The Feedback Tool

Before you start testing, here's how to give feedback:

Look on the right edge of your screen — you should see a vertical tab that says "Feedback" in white text on a blue-to-teal gradient background.

**How to Use It:**
- **Desktop:** Click the feedback button on the right side to open the form
- **Mobile/Tablet:** Tap the feedback button on the right edge (may appear as just an icon)

**Use This Tool Liberally Throughout Your Testing!**

Submit feedback for:
- Things that work great
- Things that don't work (broken links, errors, bugs)
- Ideas for improvement
- Things that are confusing
- Mobile/desktop issues
- Design suggestions
- Accessibility problems

The form automatically captures which page you're on, your browser info, and timestamp. I receive a daily digest of all feedback, so I'll see your comments and can follow up if you provide your email.
